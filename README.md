# Treehouse-Defence-V2
an updated version of the treehouse defence game that I coded with the help of treehouse academy. 
During the next videos we went over the other two principles of OOP (polymorphism and abstraction) whilst extending the treehouse defence game. We extended some classes and added polymorphisms of existing ones (different versions of invaders and towers)
We went over a different way to write the OnPath method that I coded myself last time which is a slightly cleaner better way.
When I come to add functionality to the game such as multiple levels and randomly generated paths I will be adding it to this version.
